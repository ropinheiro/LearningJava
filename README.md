Dump place for my projects where I'm learning JAVA

## blogmania

Web App that actually returns Hello World string.

Based on learnings from https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/#scratch

Actually being changed to include producers and consumers for a Kafka cluster.

## titlecase-converter

Desktop App that converts some input text to a Title Case format.

Based on learnings from https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/setting-up-java-development-environment

When you build in IntelliJ, the jar file is generated in

Execute it by opening a Command Prompt, going to that folder and running:

> java -jar titlecase-converter.jar
